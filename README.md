Executive Summary - Traveltide Loyalty Program
Introduction TravelTide, a leading travel agency, seeks to enhance its customer rewards program to better align with the needs and preferences of its diverse customer base. To achieve this goal, a data-driven approach was employed to analyze customer behaviors and identify key segments that would benefit from specific rewards program perks. This project, conducted using Google Sheets and Tableau, aimed to provide actionable insights that would help refine and target the rewards offerings more effectively.

Problem The primary challenge facing TravelTide was the need to optimize its rewards program to increase customer retention and satisfaction. With a broad and varied customer base, the existing one-size-fits-all rewards program lacked the precision needed to effectively engage different customer segments. The company sought to understand which behaviors and preferences correlated with specific perks, allowing for a more personalized and effective rewards strategy.

Methodology The project began with data cleaning. Key variables such as booking frequency, discount usage, trip distances, and travel patterns were extracted and organized in Google Sheets. Data cleaning and preprocessing were carried out to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Customer segmentation was performed by identifying behavioral markers that aligned with five hypothesized rewards program perks. These segments were then analyzed and visualized using Tableau to uncover patterns and correlations between customer behaviors and their preferences for specific rewards.

Grouping The analysis grouped customers into distinct segments based on their behaviors and preferences. The groups were identified as follows:

Frequent Last-Minute Bookers: Customers who frequently book flights at the last minute and are highly price-sensitive.
Business Travelers: Frequent travelers, often on business, who prioritize time-saving perks like priority boarding.
High-Value Customers: Customers who book high-priced tickets, particularly for international flights, and show a preference for premium perks like business class upgrades.
International Travelers with Layovers: Customers who often take international flights with long layovers and value comfort-related perks like lounge access.
Family Travelers: Customers who travel with family or on extended trips and prefer perks such as extra baggage allowance.
Results

The analysis revealed that each customer segment had distinct preferences that could be leveraged to tailor the rewards program more effectively. For example, frequent last-minute bookers responded well to discounts on future bookings, while high-value customers showed a strong interest in business class upgrades and lounge access.

The findings suggest that TravelTide can significantly enhance its rewards program by targeting these segments with specific perks. Additionally, some perks, such as priority boarding and lounge access, showed potential for bundling, offering further opportunities to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.

By implementing these insights, TravelTide can not only improve its rewards program but also foster stronger relationships with its customers, ultimately driving higher engagement and retention rates.
